# GeeksforGeeks DSA Practice

This repository contains my solutions, notes, and explanations for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/).  
The goal is to **understand concepts deeply**, practice coding, and prepare for interviews.

---

## Coding Guidelines

- Each problem is implemented in a **single `.py` file**.  
- Code is **commented** for clarity, explaining the approach and complexity.  
- Function names and variables are **self-explanatory**.  
- Aim for **clean, readable, and maintainable code**.
